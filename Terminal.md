## Terminal

He fired up his computer, the computer had an SSD, it took like eight or nine seconds for the computer to start. He found himself looking blank at his
greatly customized terminal window for a long time. (Greatly explain the terminal here, talk about zsh, themes, fonts). He wanted to work on
the project he started two days ago but he couldn't. It was a hobby project about signal processing. He kept writing and deleting _Emma_ to the command line. Altering the capitalization of all the letters in the
word. Like EmmA, eMMa, EmMa. He did this for at least five minutes then he recognized there is no music playing. He knows that he can never work without music, most of the times, it is techno but it can other genres as well. He started to look for something new, something he hasn't listened to before.He then stood up and decided to get some tea. THE END.
