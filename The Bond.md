He was reading Cosmos at the beach and listening to Carbon Based Lifeforms.
The weather was cloudy and there was this beautifully smelling breeze coming from the sea.
While reading his book, he was also thinking about the earth, the stars and sometimes he was imagining shapes on the clouds.
And suddenly he felt the movement, it was like somebody was shaking the sunbed he was lying on.
He looked around, there was nobody except his friend, lying on a sunbed next to him and looking at him.
They looked at each other in the eyes and asked "Is this an earthquake?"
It was an earthquake, he didn't panic, they were at the safest place.
He and his friend enjoyed the magnificient phenomenon for a couple more seconds thinking they were really lucky.
It was an amazing and unbelievable connection with the nature they thought.
