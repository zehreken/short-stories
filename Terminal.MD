## Terminal

He fired up his computer, the computer had an SSD, it took like eight or nine seconds to start the computer. He found himself looking at his
greatly customized terminal window for a long time. (Greatly explain the terminal here, talk about zsh, themes, font). He wanted to work on
the project but he couldn't. He kept writing and deleting _Emma_ to the command line. Altering the capitalization of all the letters in the
word. Like EmmA, eMMa, EmMa. He did this for at least five minutes then he stood up to get some tea. THE END.
